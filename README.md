# College-Complain-Management
It becomes very difficult for college Students to file complain and also it become difficult for admin to resolve the complain via mail. Because Searching complain on mail
and resolving is tedious task. Also managing history of complains is difficult  as it will be useful for future students to see all the past complains and its resolution. We have tried to solve this problem to a extent via using this our MERN project.</br></br></br>
It is a platform for a college institution to manage the complains of the student on a single platform in better way. The process is very simple.</br>
